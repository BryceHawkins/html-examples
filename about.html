              <p>Hey what's up my name is Bryce Hawkins and I have built and designed this webstie from the ground up with CSS and HTML. I took Multimedia 1 last year and I really liked it so I decided to take it again this year, but this year its more into Web Design. The picture above this caption was created in MM1 last year and that's me in between Beavis and Butthead. I live in Southern California and thats a little bit about me.</p>

              <p>The picture above was also created in Photoshop last year in MM1. I decided to take a picture and make myself into an Avatar it wasn't that hard to do but it did take some time. Also, an interesting fact about me is that I really like to work with computers.</p>
